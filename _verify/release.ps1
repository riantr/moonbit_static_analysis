# ONE local release entry point.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `.github/workflows/gate.yml` runs four commands -- fmt,
# check, one test target, one build. That is the floor CI enforces, and it is not
# wrong; it is just much smaller than what this project actually relies on. The
# mutation gates, the self-scan and the corpus comparison all run locally or not
# at all, so a regression in any of them reaches a tag behind a green CI badge.
# Every stage below is something this repository has been changed by before.
#
# The order is not arbitrary:
#
#   1. The suite is proven green BEFORE any mutation gate runs. A mutation count
#      against a red suite means nothing, and mutate_lib.ps1 aborts on a red
#      baseline for exactly that reason. Proving it here too means the failure is
#      reported as "the tests are red" rather than as fourteen confusing gates.
#   2. `moon fmt --check` runs first because a formatter that wants to rewrite a
#      file makes every later measurement a moving target.
#   3. The corpus comparison is last because it is the only stage needing a build,
#      and the slowest per unit of information.
#   4. The published-package self-scan sits after the mutation gates because it is
#      the one stage that depends on something outside this repository, so it should
#      not be reached until everything local is already known good.
#
# The mutation gates pin their own targets. 0412/0413 need wasm; 0423-0429 run js;
# 0418-0422 run wasm. That is not a detail to standardise away -- `src/sa` needs
# the async runtime, so on js those packages degrade and their tests do not run,
# and a js run of 0412 manufactures two false survivors. Each gate knows its own;
# this file does not second-guess it.

# The first version of this file read `if (-not (Stage 'name' { ... })) { $failed += 'name' }`.
# That never fails. In PowerShell a function's return value is EVERYTHING it wrote
# to the output stream, so a Stage that prints twelve lines returns an array of
# twelve things; that array is truthy whatever the stage did, `-not` makes it false,
# and `$failed` stays empty. Every stage below would have reported ok while failing,
# and the run would have printed RELEASE GATE PASSED with a red suite.

# This is the same trap that made `mutate_0429.ps1` exit 0 after aborting, and the

# --- 6  corpus comparison ----------------------------------------------------
# Measured WITH --extern-iface-dir .repos on this tree. Another set of
# numbers is in circulation that was taken WITHOUT that flag and is not
# comparable: proton reads 2142 that way and 2107 with it.
#
# The 0.4.30 move, and it is worth stating what each change did rather than only
# where it landed:
#   moui   parsed 534 -> 547 -> 571. The `match` subject on the next line, then
#          an arrow lambda in EXPRESSION position -- which turned out to be the
#          largest single cause all along, and which I had ranked wrong for
#          several increments because the scanner's reason strings for it are
#          "unexpected token `:`" and "expected `)`".
#   async  actionable 13 -> 14, proton 54 -> 61. NOT new defects: these are
#          findings that an over-permissive lookahead in `at_lambda_head` was
#          HIDING. Bounding that scan made it precise, and eight latent false
#          positives became visible:
#            4x `undefined name 'noraise'`   proton, `fn f() -> T noraise {`
#            3x `no visible binding for 'InvalidSetting'`  proton, a suberror
#                variant used in a DIFFERENT file from its declaration
#            1x `undefined name 'Waiting'`    async, same cross-file shape
#          Verified by A/B, not assumed: the same two corpora were rescanned
#          with the guard removed (gate 0434's M4) and with the bounds removed
#          (M3). Both hardenings present -> the 8 rows appear. Guard removed
#          alone -> they do NOT, because the bounds stop the scan first. Bounds
#          removed alone -> they do NOT, because the guard stops the scan first.
#          Both removed -> the original failure, `PARSED 0/1`.
#          So `noraise` is a real missing production and the other four are the
#          known per-file `enum_ctors` limitation, both recorded rather than
#          re-hidden: a lookahead wide enough to eat a `=>` sixty lines away is
#          not a reading worth keeping.
#
#   moui   parsed 571 -> 576, and +5 rather than the +4 the blocker list
#          predicted: `..<=` also unblocks one file whose first error was
#          something else entirely and was only reachable afterwards.
#   async  notices 962 -> 964, unreliable 2269 -> 2266, actionable UNCHANGED at
#          14. Two `..<=` uses were already inside files that parsed, and each
#          now emits the inclusive-end subset notice instead of counting as
#          unreadable. Nothing else moved.
#
# The `is Type::Ctor` move, and the ranking it corrects:
#   moui   parsed 576 -> 581, exactly the 5 files the re-rank named, and NOT one
#          more. unreliable 475 -> 406, notices 3955 -> 3999: 69 findings that had
#          been withheld past an unreadable boundary are now read.
#   proton parsed UNCHANGED at 101, actionable UNCHANGED at 61, unreliable
#          950 -> 927. proton has `is` patterns already inside files that parsed,
#          so this removes 23 unreadable findings and adds no defect.
#   The other four corpora are byte-identical to the previous pin. A change that
#          moves one corpus and leaves five alone is the expected shape here, and
#          is why the pin is per-corpus rather than one total.
#
# AND THE RANKING WAS WRONG AGAIN, in a new way. The backlog called this "`is`
# pattern in EXPRESSION position". `parse_is` has existed at the right precedence
# tier for several releases; what was missing is that `parse_is_pattern` never
# consumed the `::` of a QUALIFIED head, because the lexer has no `TColonColon`
# and `::` is two `TColon` tokens. The scanner's reason string therefore read
# "unexpected token `:`" on a line whose only `:` is a path marker -- which is the
# fourth time a reason string has been the wrong thing to rank by, and the fourth
# time `blockers.ps1` (which joins each reason back to its blocking SOURCE LINE)
# gave the opposite answer.
#
# The same re-rank turned up a gap with 48 sites and ONE blocked file.
# `is @pkg.Type::Ctor` does not parse at all -- the head token is `@`, not a name.
# Scanning each of moui's 16 such files ALONE (`_verify/pkg_head_impact.ps1`):
# 15 come back parsed, because their site sits inside a skipped `test` block, and
# exactly one -- `backend/macos/macos_services.mbt` -- is blocked. That file is
# also one of the four that print no `PARTIAL` line, so cross-referencing it
# against `blockers.ps1` gives OVERLAP 0 and the gap reads as free. ⇒ 判据: a
# lower bound that agrees with "no problem" is not evidence of no problem. Pinned
# as a KNOWN LIMIT in `parser_0436_test.mbt`, not fixed here.
#
# The `(expr : Type)` move, and the first UNDER-delivery of the round:
#   moui   parsed 581 -> 583. The blocker list named SIX files behind this
#          construct and only TWO came free. The other four fail EARLIER, on
#          something else, and were never reachable by fixing the ascription --
#          which is what "the blocker list ranks by FIRST error" means, and it
#          is now the third increment in a row where the list's count and the
#          delivered count disagree (the `is` one delivered +5 against +5, the
#          `..<=` one +5 against +4, this one +2 against +6).
#
#          So a row count in `blockers.ps1` is NOT a forecast, and ranking by it
#          is a heuristic rather than a measurement. Delivered so far: `is` +5,
#          `..<=` +5, ascription +2 -- which does not preserve the order the
#          lists gave.
#          unreliable 406 -> 335 and withheld 51 -> 34: 71 findings that were
#          withheld past an unreadable boundary are now read. notices rose
#          3999 -> 4050, which is the expected direction -- a file that parses
#          produces subset-exclusion notices a file that stops early cannot.
#   The other FIVE corpora are byte-identical to the previous pin, proton
#   included. A change that moves one corpus and leaves five alone is the shape
#   to expect from a construct no other corpus uses.
#
# The scope of that fix is narrower than the six lines suggested, and the
# toolchain settled it rather than convenience. Four forms, one package each,
# canary beside every one:
#   `('0' : Int)`                  MOON-OK  <- the only legal form, implemented
#   `let y = 1 : Int`              MOON-BAD (no parentheses: rejected)
#   `(1 : Int, 2)`                 MOON-BAD (ascription on a tuple element)
#   `(s : Int)` where `s : String` MOON-BAD (so: an ASSERTION, not a coercion)
#
# The last one is why there is NO subset-exclusion notice, and it is the mirror
# of gate 0435's `..<=`. That one discards a value too and DOES get a notice,
# because an inclusive end changes n iterations into n+1. An ascription changes
# nothing at runtime -- the compiler has already checked the type -- so
# announcing a subset exclusion there would report a loss that does not happen.
# Gate 0437's M3 invents exactly that notice and is killed by a CONTROL that
# compares the two spellings' report counts, not by a positive test.
#
# The `value[:]` move -- the largest single jump of the round, and the one that
# COST something:
#   moui   parsed 583 -> 590 (+7, the largest of the round). unreliable 335 -> 246
#          and withheld 34 -> 2: 87 findings that were withheld past an unreadable
#          boundary are now read. The blocked set falls 25 -> 18.
#   proton parsed 101 -> 103, unreliable 927 -> 914
#   async  parsed 226 -> 227, unreliable 2266 -> 2199
#   labeler and moonbit_image byte-identical in parsed; labeler's unreliable
#          332 -> 320
#
#   *** moui actionable 0 -> 1, proton actionable 61 -> 63. ***
#   The first time in this release cycle that reading MORE files has raised an
#   actionable anywhere, and it is not a regression -- but it is not free either,
#   so here is the whole accounting, file by file, rather than "no new defects":
#
#     moui   backend/macos/macos_native_ime.mbt:437  parameter 'prefix' may not
#            be used (UnusedParam, structural). `prefix` IS used, at line 442,
#            inside a `catch { }` body. The postfix `catch` arm consumes its
#            block with `skip_braces`, so a read that happens ONLY there is
#            invisible. That limitation is PINNED as a KNOWN LIMIT at
#            `parser_0432_test.mbt:155` and re-pinned for the deferred form at
#            `pipeline_0433_test.mbt:172`, whose note already records "proton
#            facade_bridge.mbt:584 and 17 other lines in the six corpora".

#     proton internal/native/app_control.mbt:5  undefined name 'noraise'
#            (structural+type). `parse_raise_effect` handles `!` and `raise E`
#            but not `noraise`, which `moonfiles.mbt`'s own `is_error_modifier`
#            lists as one of four. A recorded missing production.
#
#     proton updater/hex.mbt:22 and :45  no visible binding for
#            'MalformedSignature' (structural, x2). A suberror variant used in a
#            DIFFERENT file from its declaration -- the per-file `enum_ctors`
#            limitation, already recorded, and the same shape as the
#            'InvalidSetting' x3 rows from the 0.4.30 A/B.
#
#   All three are pre-existing limitations of this analyzer on code `moon check`
#   accepts; none is caused by the slice change, which only made the files
#   readable. This is the shape README.md already describes: reading more files
#   raises false positives before lowering them.
#
#   It is still the first time moui's actionable has left 0, and that number is
#   the standing objective's own metric. The pin moves UP with the reason
#   written here rather than quietly, and fixing the `catch`-body limitation is
#   the way to move it back -- it is now the cheapest thing on the board, since
#   the finding is already located and already pinned as a defect.
